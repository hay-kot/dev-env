## Setup
1. [Install CookieCutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/1.7.2/installation.html)
    ```bash
    pip install --user cookiecutter
    ```
2. Put this directory and CookieCutter in your windows PATH. 
3. Change CookieCutter config to reference `./CookieCutter/custom-config.yml`

## Setup CookieCutter Scripts
1. Change Project Parent Director for ps1 scripts in `cc.ps1`

   ```powershell
   # Set Dump Directory for Projects
   Set-Variable -Name "ProjectDir" -Value "C:\MAIN\PROJECT\DIRECTORY"  # This is where your projects will be created

   # Set Directory of your CookieCutters
   Set-Variable -Name "CookieCutterDir" -Value "C:\PATH\TO\COOKIECUTTERS" # This is where your CookieCutters Live
   Write-Output "Default Project Dir: $ProjectDir"
   ```

## Description and Use
#### cc.ps1 - `cc <template>`
This is the main cookiecutter script that takes in 1 argument that is the appended name to your template. For Example, if you were to call the `cookiecutter-flask` template you would traditionally use `cookiecutter cookiecutter-flask`. With this script you call `cc flask` instead.

This assumes that your templates are located in the `C:\PATH\TO\COOKIECUTTERS` that you previously set. This script also performs some other set-up tasks associated with creating a python project enviroment

**Execution Order:**
      1. Checks is CookieCutter template exists
      2. Calls CookieCutter and takes in user inputs.
      3. Traverses into directory and creates a virtual enviroment using the venv alias in this directory
      4. Upgrade Pip
      5. Install requirements.txt
      6. Open project with VSCode

#### venv.ps1 - `venv`
